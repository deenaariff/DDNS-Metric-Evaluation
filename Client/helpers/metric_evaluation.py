	This file takes values acquired by the the client from network communication with the load balancer about the result of certain queries.
	Whether the result of the query is what is expected, the metric evaluator will record a success or failure and return a final result.
	
	Required parameters in response object/json:
		val: the value returned by the query
		id: the id of the set value query that this is a response to
		immediate: whether the response was for a query that was made immediately after the set. False for made after a response

	New metric evaluator for changed formats and expected variables.
	Set responses no longer get a response from the load balancer
	Get responses reply with {valid, id, var, val}
		valid: boolean on whether the variable exists on the system yet
		id: id of the get response
		var: variable being queried
		val: value of the variable from the query
