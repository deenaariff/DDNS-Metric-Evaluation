	This is the main file to run the client-side of the project.
	First, the client calls commandParser to load the test set to use and store it as a list.
	Next, the client calls each command in sequential order. The client will wait for responses.
	Then, the client will record the result by passing it into metric_evaluation.py
	Finally, once all commands are made and responses received, the final metrics will be logged.
